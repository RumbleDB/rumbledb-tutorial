## What is RumbleDB?

RumbleDB

## Installation notes

RumbleDB can be installed in four different ways:
- As a standalone Java jar that contains all it needs (for use on a laptop)
- As a thin jar for use with an existing Apache Spark installation (for use on a laptop or a cluster)
- As a docker image (for use on a laptop)
- As a brew recipe (for use on a laptop running macOS)

For this tutorial, we will use the standalone Java jar, because this is the most straightforward way to get started.

## Java

First, you need to install Java. We will use Java 11.

We recommend using the Adoptium distribution, which has an Apache 2.0 license. The Adoptium distribution can be installed from [this page](https://adoptium.net/en-GB/temurin/releases/?version=11). You need to download the version that corresponds to your operating system.
